    <h1>Hello Everyone!!!</h1>
  <p> I am Srivarshini, I am a realistic Portrait Artist. In my childhood, I started to draw like every other child. 
    I started from the scratch where I just scribbled whatever I saw, But never knew that it is going to be my passion. I am grateful that I've been blessed with this skill, but worked really hard to enhance and develop this gifted skill.
</p>

   <p>
    Always Participated in every school art competitions, and got many Prizes which boosted and motivated me to continue doing what I love. But due to certain reasons I gave up on drawing for few years. 2020 was the bestest year of my Drawing journey, I would say. Even though Covid-19 was ruling the world, the lockdown gave me time and patience to restart my Drawing journey. I practiced each and everyday to become more and more realistic portrait artist. 
    I am thankful to my elder sister for being my teacher and motivator, who has equal responsibility to be whom I am today. 
   </p>
   <p>
    The upcoming drawings are few of my favourites that I've done (after 2020).

    Commision Works
  </h2>
  <p> 
    I started my own Art account in instagram, which I considered as the bridge between my artworks and the outside world.
    I then started My own art business, where I drew realistic Portraits in commision basis. I've so far done 50+ commision works(as of 2023) across the country. Eventhough I am an Engineering student, This drives me to follow my passion and to be up to date in the field.

  </p>
  <p> Here are few of my Commision works.</p>

    “It is only by drawing often, drawing everything, drawing incessantly, that one fine day you discover, to your surprise, that you have rendered something in its true character.” Camille Pissarro

<p>
    Drawing is where I find peace. I enjoy each and every details. Art has no limit, as the saying I hope I indulge into this art world even more and continue doing my Passion.
